***Developer Always Learning ***

My name is Bryan Orozco and I am currently a sophomore at California State University of Fullerton, building my version of the digital world one step at a time. Some of my interests are Game Development and AI. All coding projects are built from ground up, from planning to designing all the way to solving real life problems.
