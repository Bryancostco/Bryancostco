# Bryan Orozco

** `Developer always learning `**

My name is Bryan Orozco and I am a sophomore at California State University of Fullerton, building my version of the digital world one step at a time. Some of my interests are Game Development and AI. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning to designing to solving real-life problems.
